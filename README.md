Lightweight cloud storage emulator built with Java and Spring Boot, designed to run on local machine and be accessible from any device on the same network.
This project simulates key features of services like AWS S3. It stems from that I cant personally take my laptop with me to campus(Broke it and I use it via monitor) so I need a way to access my local storage.   Will soon be deployed on AWS so I can access it 24/7.
